    <h3> Nandi Hills Travel Guide : Tourist timings and rates</h3>
    <p> Let's begin with all the things a visitor should know before traveling : the timings, entry fee, and what to
        expect during the pandemic.</p>

    <p> Nandi Hills Timings : The Nandi Hills is open from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm on all days of the year. </p>
    <h3> Best time to visit Nandi Hills</h3>
    <p> The best time to visit Nandi Hills is early morning. To experience the beautiful sunrise, be there by 6:30 am.
        The gates to Nandi Hills open at 6. But be an hour earlier to avoid long waiting lines.
        The hills being a very popular spot, it's hard to find a spot for your vehicle to park (or even go up). When we
        visited, the gates were still shut. We'd made it there by 5 am and we were in front of the queue. But even being there early at 5, there were
        already a dozen bikes and cars ahead of us before the gate. While we waited for an hour till 6, the queue of
        vehicles kept piling up behind us.</p>
    <h3> How much time does it take to visit Nandi Hills?</h3>
    <p> It takes 2-3 hours to experience the Nandi Hills sunrise at the top, walk around the gardens, and explore some
        historic places like the Tipu Summer Palace</p>
    <h3>Nandi Hills Entry Fee</h3>
    <p>The entry fee for Nandi Hills cost Rs 175 when we visited including the car parking.

        The prices on most sites haven't been updated, but the prices have hiked a lot since GST. The cost for entry has
        almost doubled in 3 years. Here are the updated prices:
