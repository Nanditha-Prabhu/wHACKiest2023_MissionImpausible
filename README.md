# wHACKiest2023_MissionImpausible
Code_RIT had arranged a 24 hour online hackathon named wHACKiest. In this hackathon our team name was MissionImpausible. We had selected tourism as our topic 
among other 3 topics. Here we tried to create a web application which will ensure user's safety while travelling. Though we didnot finish our project, we tried
our best to make the website.
